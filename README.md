# Data Science Bootcamp Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Bootcamp repository! This repository contains a collection of Python tasks, exploratory data analysis (EDA) files, and machine learning algorithm implementations. Additionally, it showcases three exciting Python projects: LMS (Library Management System), Snake Game, and Typing Speed Tester.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA files in this repository focus on analyzing student data. Through this analysis, we gain valuable insights into various factors that impact student performance and success. The EDA process involves examining the dataset, identifying patterns, and uncovering relationships among different variables.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Two fundamental machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest Classifier, are implemented in this repository. These algorithms are powerful tools for predictive modeling and classification tasks.

1. Linear Regression: This algorithm aims to establish a linear relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. It enables us to make predictions and understand the impact of different features on the target variable.

2. Random Forest Classifier: The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. It is widely used for classification tasks, providing robustness and handling complex data patterns effectively.

## Projects

In addition to the EDA and machine learning algorithms, this repository showcases three Python projects:

### LMS (Library Management System)

The Library Management System is a Python-based application that leverages file handling capabilities to efficiently manage library data. With features such as displaying books, issuing and returning books, and adding new books, this system simplifies library operations.

**Key Features:**
- Display Books: View a list of available books in the library.
- Issue Books: Process book issuance requests and update the inventory accordingly.
- Add Books: Add new books to the library's collection.
- Return Books: Handle book returns, updating availability status.

**Enhancements I'm Working On:**
- Due Date Management: Implement a due date system for better book tracking.
- Patron Management: Develop functionality to manage library members.
- Fine Management: Incorporate a fine calculation system for overdue books.
- Separate Dashboards: Create distinct interfaces for administrators and regular users.

### Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a growing snake, aiming to avoid collisions while consuming food items. This Python implementation brings the game to life with a graphical user interface (GUI) for an engaging gaming experience.

**Key Features:**
- GUI Interface: Utilizes the Tkinter framework to create a visually appealing interface.
- Food Generation: Randomly generates food items on the game board for the snake to eat and grow.
- Collision Detection: Handles interactions between the snake, food, and game boundaries.
- Game Over Screen: Displays a game over screen when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.

**Enhancements I'm Working On:**
- Score Tracking: Implement a system to keep track of players' scores.
- Display of Highest Scores: Showcase the highest achieved scores for added competition.
- Adjustable Difficulty Levels: Allow players to choose different levels of gameplay difficulty.

### Typing Speed Tester

The Typing Speed Tester is a handy tool designed to assess and measure an individual's typing speed and accuracy. Users can practice and improve their typing skills while receiving real-time feedback on their performance.

**Key Features:**
- Timed Typing Exercises: Measure words per minute (WPM) by completing timed typing exercises.
- Accuracy Evaluation: Assess users' typing accuracy by comparing their input with the provided text.

**Enhancements I'm Working On:**
- Progress Tracking: Enable users to monitor their typing speed and accuracy improvement over time.
- Adjustable Difficulty Level: Provide options to adjust the difficulty level to suit users' skill levels.
- Error Highlighting: Highlight typing errors to help users identify areas for improvement.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with these projects. I'm continuously working on enhancing their functionality and adding new features. Your feedback is highly appreciated.

Happy coding! üöÄüìäüêç
