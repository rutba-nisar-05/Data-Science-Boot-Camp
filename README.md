-> These are 2 separate projects I made for a Data Science Boot Camp, using Python.

-> For the classic Snake Game, I tried to incorporate GUI to make the game look visually appealing.

-> The second project is a Typing Speed Tester which provides the user with the total time taken to type the prompt, the user's typing speed (WPM) and accuracy.

-> As I am a beginner, both the projects have slight issues in them which I am currently trying to solve. The projects don't seem to run well on Jupyter Notebook whereas they work fine when cmd is used.
