These are 3 projects that I made for a Data Science Boot Camp using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LMS (Library Management System):
-> The Library Management System is developed using Python programming language, leveraging its file handling capabilities to store and retrieve data. Python's built-in file handling functions, such as reading from and writing to text files, are utilized to manage the library's data.
-> Key Features: Display Books, 
                 Issue Books, 
                 Add Books and 
                 Return Books.
-> Enhancements I'm Working On: Due Date Management,
                                Patron Management,
                                Fine Management and
                                Seperate Dashboards for Admin and User

Snake Game:
-> Classic arcade game where players control a growing snake and avoid collisions while collecting food. It is implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a visual gaming experience.
-> Key Features: Utilises a GUI framework, Tkinter, to create a graphical interface for the game,
                 Randomly generates food items on the game board for the snake to eat and grow,
                 Collision detection to handle interactions between the snake, food, and game boundaries and
                 Display a game over screen when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
-> Enhancements I'm Working On: Score Tracking,
                                Display of Highest Scores and
                                Adjustable Difficulty Levels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typing Speed Tester:
-> The Typing Speed Tester is a tool designed to assess and measure an individual's typing speed and accuracy. It provides a platform for users to practice and improve their typing skills while receiving real-time feedback on their performance.
-> Key Features: Timed typing exercises to measure words per minute (WPM) and
                 Accuracy evaluation of users' typing by comparing their input with the provided text
-> Enhancements I'm Working On: Progress Tracking of typing speed and accuracy over time, enabling users to monitor their improvement and set goals.
                                Adjustable difficulty level to suit users' skill level.
                                Highlighting the typing errors.

* Use command prompt for a better experience as there appears to be some issues when the code is run on jupyter notebook. I'm trying to resolve this issue currently.
