-> These are 3 projects I made for a Data Science Boot Camp, using Python.

-> A very simple and basic libraray management system project using file handling concepts.

-> A classic Snake Game, in which I tried to incorporate GUI to make the game look visually appealing.

-> A Typing Speed Tester which provides the user with the total time taken to type the prompt, the user's typing speed (WPM) and accuracy.

-> As I am a beginner, the projects have slight issues in them which I am currently trying to solve. The projects don't seem to run well on Jupyter Notebook whereas they work fine when cmd is used.
